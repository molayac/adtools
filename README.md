Project based on DS Windows Server commands.

This projects use the dsquery, dsrem, dsadd, dsmod, and others ds commands for Active Directory Windows service.

This project started on 2013 year as a help to reduce time and costs on simple actions like reset password, create users, and changes groups or update information to outsourcing services. 

You can config many domains, and two roles, for now; the domains are Domain Services, with Account Operator credentials.
Developed using JAVA and spring boot, not the best practices, it was when I start to learn to develop In JAVA, web applications.
Use a Sqlite Data Base. With bad practices... :P

I will be uploading the project in a few days.
